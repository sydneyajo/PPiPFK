This project will focus on analyzing the diversity of the PPi-PFK protein. 

### TITLE:

Comparative Genomics Uncovers the Evolutionary Trajectory and Broader Distribution of Pyrophosphate-Dependent Phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) as an Alternative Phosphorylation Substrate in Glycolysis

### DESCRIPTION:

This study employs comparative genomics and phylogenetics to examine the distribution, evolutionary dynamics, and functional role of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) across diverse organisms. By identifying homologs and previously unannotated sequences, we aim to expand recognition of PPi-PFK beyond known species. Our findings will elucidate its evolutionary trajectory, metabolic significance, and relationship to ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases in central carbon metabolism.

### DATA COLLECTION: 

Approximately 3500 sequences were collected from 2023 "Pyrophosphate as allosteric regulator of ATP-phosphofructokinase in Clostridium thermocellum and other bacteria with ATP- and PPi-phosphofructokinases" by Teun Kuil, Carolus  M.K. Nurminen , Antonius J.A. van Maris : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37380119/

- Some of these sequences include ATP- and PPi-PFKs (with and without PPase), and ATP-only PFK. 
  
- I have also run BLASTp on my target organism, *C. thermocellum* using: 

### BASE SCRIPT

```
#!/bin/bash
source /opt/bifxapps/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
unset $PYTHONPATH

#Activate the example BLAST environment from the Readme file (you need to follow the commands to create it first)
conda activate blast.env

blastp -query Ctherm_DSM1313.fasta -db nr -out CthermPPi_blastp_output.tsv -outfmt '6 qstart qend sstart send sacc ssciname stitle pident evalue qlen sseq' -evalue 0.00000001 -max_target_seqs 10000000 -remote

conda deactivate blast.env
```

#### Details as of Feburary 11th, 2025

I ran this script on C. thermocellum PPi-PFK (positive control/target sequence), *C. thermocellum* ATP-PFK (negative control), and Human Liver ATP-PFK (Eukaryotic sample). 

As of Feb 11th, 2025, I am taking note of more organisms that are referred to in literature to utilize PPi-PFK, and creating a spreadsheet for a pHMMR run to collect more homologs. 

The UniProt KEGG Orthology numbers I have stored are: 
- K00850
- K16370
- K21071
- K24182

These are all links to the amino acid sequences

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the larger project, I will be utilizing a mass of NCBI representative genomes to get a broad idea of the distribution of PPi-PFK and similar homologs across genus. I want to compare organisms that harbor ATP- and PPi- dependent genes, and in some cases organisms have the genes for both versions of the protein.

## Downloading RAxML and IQ Tree: 

From this link: https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng
I downloaded the compiled binary for RAxML-NG, which is a phylogenetic tree inference tool which uses maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality criterion

For now, I placed this: /Users/sydneyjohnston/Desktop/Botany_563/Project/PPiPFK/RAxML_NG_1.2.2
which is where it must be run.

To check if it works, I entered the command: 

```
./raxml-ng -v
``` 

After going to finder to open the executable with a right click and accepting the risk of online download. 

To utilize the test data they provide: 
```
git clone https://github.com/amkozlov/ng-tutorial.git
``` 

Checking for MSA: 
```
./raxml-ng --check --msa ng-tutorial/bad.fa --model GTR+G
```

./raxml-ng --msa PFK-aligned_CW.fasta \
           --data-type AA \
           --model PROTGTR \
           --prefix T3 \
           --threads 2 \
           --seed 2



#### IQ Tree ####
In a new environment: 
  ```
  conda create -n phylogeny_env
  ```
  
I ran the install command for iqtree:
  ```
  conda install -c bioconda iqtree
  ```
  
### Running IQ Tree ### 
After checking iqtree -h (there are many modifiers), I ran a command on the ClustalW aligned file: 

```
iqtree -s PFK-aligned_CW.fasta
```

Analysis results written to: 
  IQ-TREE report:                PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.iqtree
  Maximum-likelihood tree:       PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.treefile
  Likelihood distances:          PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.mldist
  


### Installing MrBayes ###

Navigating to the desired directory (kdkdkdkdkd)
run the following set of commands: 

brew tap brewsci/bio
brew install mrbayes open-mpi
$which mb 

This will indicate the version. The output is: 

                            MrBayes 3.2.7a arm

_______________________________________________________________________________


I decided to run the alignment on MAFFT for comparison. See MAFFT. 

Then, to see that comparison better, I want to add bootstraps into the CW IQtree:
switch the environments: 

conda deactivate
conda activate phylogeny_env

iqtree -s PFK-aligned_CW.fasta -m LG+F+G4 -bb 1000 -alrt 1000

When attempting to rerun this IQtree for bootstraps, it is asking about overwriting the previously made files. 
I will have to do this, but in order to 'save' the previous results, I:
  1) updated git to my current version
  2) renamed the previous output files so they do not get overwritten. 
  
  PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.treefile  --> PFK-aligned_CW.firstrun.treefile
  PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.model.gz --> PFK-aligned_CW.firstrun.model.gz
  PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.mldist --> PFK-aligned_CW.firstrun.mldist
  PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.log  -->  PFK-aligned_CW.firstrun.log
  PFK-aligned_CW.fasta.iqtree  --> PFK-aligned_CW.firstrun.iqtree
  
  altered the command to:

iqtree -s PFK-aligned_CW.fasta -m LG+F+G4 -bb 1000 -alrt 1000 -redo

Feature | ClustalW | MAFFT | Commentary/Comparison
Alignment Length | 521 columns | 608 columns | MAFFT aligned longer â€” added more gaps.
Distinct Patterns | 462 | 499 | MAFFT has slightly more unique patterns.
Informative Sites | 308 | 294 | ClustalW has slightly more parsimony-informative sites.
Singleton Sites | 106 | 114 | MAFFT has a few more "noise" sites.
Constant Sites | 107 | 200 | MAFFT has a lot more uniform positions.
Gap % | 32% | 42% | MAFFT introduced significantly more gaps.
Composition Failures | 5 | 5 | Same â€” no difference here.


Alignment | Strengths | Weaknesses
ClustalW :
    More parsimony-informative sites (strong signal for phylogeny). Lower gap %.
    Shorter alignment, maybe missing minor signal.
    
MAFFT :
    More total unique patterns. Longer alignment (could recover weak signals). 
    Higher gap %, slightly fewer informative sites, noisier singleton increase.



### Installing FigTree

To visualize the trees being created and compare the outputs of IQTree and MAFFT, I download FigTree. 
FigTree is a user-friendly program designed for visualizing, editing, and annotating phylogenetic trees,
making it ideal for quickly inspecting tree topology, branch support values, and evolutionary relationships

Fast and simple, local viewing. May use another program for the final product.

Upon visualizing the tree with bootstraps, one of the E.coli samples consistently showed a bootstrap value of 0. 
Ultimately, this was because the sequence is for biologically distinct (pfkB isozyme 2), and is not homologous in the same functional class.

I am removing this sample and rerunning the IQtree command for better alignment
